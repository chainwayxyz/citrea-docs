## Welcome to Citrea Devnet!

In this tutorial, we will briefly go over steps for you to get some cBTC's from out Bridge faucet. This will enable you to join & use the network. 

Since Citrea is an EVM-compatible ZK-rollup, for the best experience, you need an EVM-compatible wallet in installed in your browser. You can visit our https://docs.citrea.xyz/users/user-tooling for some wallets to use, if you do not have any wallets installed.

If you want a more detailed explanation, you can visit [this guide]() on installing Metamask from scratch. 

Let's start!

1. First, let's visit our beautiful website: https://citrea.xyz

2. Then, let's visit our Bridge page by clicking the <span style="color: orange; display: inline;">Bridge to Citrea</span> button.

3. Citrea is an EVM-compatible rollup on Bitcoin. That means: 
    - you need Bitcoins
    - you need to bridge them to the Citrea

    Through our faucet, you will get some Citrea Signet Bitcoins and they will automatically be deposited to the Citrea Devnet very easily in a few clicks.

4. Click on the Connect Wallet button, pick the wallet you want to use from the popup, then give necessary permissions to network.

If you had another network enable in your wallet, you may see a <span style="color: red; display: inline;">Wrong Network</span> message in a red button, rather than the blue <span style="color: blue; display: inline;">Connect Wallet</span> here. In that case, you can simply click on the button and change your network from the popup very easily.

Optionally, you can also check if the following information match from popups:

>
> **Network name** \
> Citrea Devnet 
> 
> **Network URL** \
> https://rpc.devnet.citrea.xyz
> 
> **Chain ID** \
> 62298
>
> **Currency symbol** \
> cBTC
>
> **Block explorer URL** \
> https://explorer.devnet.citrea.xyz
>

5. Now, if you've successfully connected your wallet, you should be able to see your address in the text box.

6. It's time to generate a taproot address for recovery. This is an important step for Citrea deposits - to learn more about it, please check the following page: https://example.org

    You can simply click on the <span style="color: blue; display: inline;">Generate New</span> button to get a system-generated Taproot Address.

7. Upon clicking, a popup will be opened with the information regarding your Taproot Address. You can download the private key & addresses by clicking the download button - in case you may need it later as discussed in the link above, in the previous step.

    In case you missed the popup, you can generate a new one by clicking again. It's fine.

8. Now, we will first send 0.01 BTC of Citrea Bitcoin Signet to the unique deposit address on your behalf. Then, this deposit will be collected by the operators & verifiers, and will be used to bridge to the Citrea Devnet via the System Contracts automatically. Let's click on the Faucet Link button, and do the verification (you may be automatically verified in the faucet popup as well).

You can check your amount from your wallet by clicking on it, and can start to use it quickly! You can send some funds to your friends, to dApps, or get some more cBTC's and start developing on Citrea! If you're interested in the latter, you're more than welcome to visit our simple development guide from [here](/developer-documentation/deployment-guide/README.md)
