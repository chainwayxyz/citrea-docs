## Welcome to Citrea Devnet!

In this tutorial, we will briefly go over steps for you to get some cBTC's from out Bridge faucet. This will enable you to join & use the network. 

Since Citrea is an EVM-compatible ZK-rollup, you need an EVM-compatible wallet in installed in your browser. You can visit our [tooling](https://docs.citrea.xyz/users/user-tooling) page to check some wallets that you can install & use, if you do not have any wallets installed.

If you want a more detailed explanation, you can visit [this guide](install-a-wallet.md) on installing a wallet (Metamask, as an example) from scratch. 

Let's start!

### Step 1

Visit our beautiful website: https://citrea.xyz

### Step 2

Visit our Bridge page by clicking the ðŸŸ Bridge to CitreaðŸŸ  button.

### Step 3

Citrea is an EVM-compatible rollup on Bitcoin. That means: 
    - you need BTCs
    - you need to bridge them to the Citrea

    Through our faucet, you will get some Devnet BTCs and they will automatically be deposited to the Citrea Devnet very easily in a few clicks. 


### Step 4 

Click on the Connect Wallet button, pick the wallet you want to use from the popup, then give necessary permissions to network.

If you had another network enable in your wallet, you may see a ðŸ”´Wrong NetworkðŸ”´ message in a red button, rather than the blue ðŸ”µConnect WalletðŸ”µ here. In that case, you can simply click on the button and change your network from the popup very easily.

<!-- Optionally, you can also check if the following information match from popups: -->

<!-- >
> **Network name** \
> Citrea Devnet 
> 
> **Network URL** \
> https://rpc.devnet.citrea.xyz
> 
> **Chain ID** \
> 62298
>
> **Currency symbol** \
> cBTC
>
> **Block explorer URL** \
> https://explorer.devnet.citrea.xyz
> -->

### Step 5

Now, if you've successfully connected your wallet, you should be able to see your address in the text box.

### Step 6

It's time to generate a taproot address for recovery. If you want a more technical explanation, you can visit [here](https://example.org).

    You can simply click on the ðŸ”µGenerate NewðŸ”µ button to get a system-generated Taproot Address.

### Step 7

Upon clicking, a popup will be opened with the information regarding your Taproot Address. While it's not that necessary for Devnet, you can download it by clicking the button.

    In case you missed the popup, you can generate a new one by clicking again. It's fine.

### Step 8

Now, we will first send 0.01 BTC to the unique deposit address on your behalf. Then, this deposit will be collected by the operators & verifiers, and will be used to bridged to the Citrea Devnet. 

Let's click on the ðŸŸ¢Faucet LinkðŸŸ¢ button, and do the verification (you may be automatically verified in the faucet popup as well).

You can check your amount from your wallet by clicking on it, and can start to use it quickly! You can send some funds to your friends, to dApps, or get some more cBTC's and start developing on Citrea! If you're interested in the latter, you're more than welcome to visit our simple development guide from [here](/developer-documentation/deployment-guide/README.md)
