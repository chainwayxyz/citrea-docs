## Welcome to Citrea Testnet!

In this tutorial, we will briefly go over steps for you to get some cBTC's from our faucet. This tutorial will enable you to join & use the network. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Citrea native $BTC is referred to as $cBTC in Citrea. cBTC in Citrea Testnet have **no real value** and theyâ€™re only used for testing purposes. Also keep in mind that **thereâ€™s no Citrea token**, and please beware of scams.
{% endhint %}

Let's start!

## Step 0: Install an EVM Wallet 

Since Citrea is an EVM-compatible ZK-rollup, you need an EVM-compatible wallet installed in your browser.

You can visit our wallet [guide](install-a-wallet.md) to check some EVM wallets that you can install & use. Following the same page, you can also find a detailed guide on installing an EVM wallet from scratch.

## Step 1: Go to our Faucet page

Visit our website, [citrea.xyz](https://citrea.xyz). Then, click the ðŸŸ Citrea TestnetðŸŸ  button and click **Faucet** from there.

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Click on the ðŸ”µConnect WalletðŸ”µ button, pick the wallet you want to use from the popup, then give necessary permissions to network.

If you have another network enabled in your wallet, you may see a ðŸ”´Wrong NetworkðŸ”´ message instead of the blue ðŸ”µConnect WalletðŸ”µ. In that case, click on the Wrong Network button to change your network to Citrea Testnet.

## Step 3: Check your EVM Address

Now, if you've successfully connected your wallet, you should be able to see your address in the text box.

If everything is correct, you can click verify that you're a human and then click ðŸŸ¢Request FaucetðŸŸ¢ button.

## Step 4: Check Your Wallet

That's it, congrats! Now you may wait a couple of seconds for transaction to take place, and then it's good to go!

You can check your balance from your wallet by clicking on it, and start using cBTCs. You can send some funds to your friends, to dApps, or get some more cBTCs!
