# Hardware Requirements for running a node

A Linux/Mac/Windows system with a configuration of

- 8 GB Ram
- 256 GB SSD (NVMe recommended)
- 4 core CPU
- 25+ Mbps network connection

satisfies the minimum requirements to run a Citrea node. 

If you encounter any problems during the node running even though you have a system that fits the requirements, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/citrea) and let us now by opening a ticket.
