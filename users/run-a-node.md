# Run a Node

There are two ways to run a Devnet Node:
- Using Docker Compose and building and running instances both Bitcoin and Citrea instances as one (simpler setup): [Docker Compose Setup](docker-compose-setup.md)
- Building and running them separately (more configurable, more technical): [Configurable Setup](configurable-setup.md)

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate visit our [Discord](https://discord.citrea.xyz) and ask us in the #developer-chat channel.
