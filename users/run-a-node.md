# Run a Node

Welcome aboard! 

In the following documents, we briefly go through the steps to run Citrea Devnet nodes that you can use to verify & analyze the chain, and also be able to use its RPC for development, deployment, and much more ideas that you come up with!

There are two ways to run a Devnet Node:
- Using Docker Compose and building and running instances both Bitcoin and Citrea instances as one (simpler setup): [Docker Compose Setup](docker-compose-setup.md)
- Building and running them separately (more configurable, more technical): [Configurable Setup](configurable-setup.md)

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate visit our [Discord](https://discord.citrea.xyz) and ask us in the #developer-chat channel. 

Enjoy!
