## Run a Bitcoin Testnet4 Node

Citrea Testnet uses Bitcoin Testnet4 as a DA layer. Thus, it is necessary to have a syncing Bitcoin Testnet4 node to run a Citrea Full Node.

In this section, we provide you two ways to run a Testnet4 node (Bitcoin v28.0rc1).

- [Method 1 (Docker)](./bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-docker.md) 
    - Easier to setup but less configurable

- [Method 2 (Source)](./bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-source.md)
    - Harder to setup but more configurable

-----

Once you're done syncing your Testnet4 node, you can proceed to run a Citrea Full Node [here](../citrea-testnet/README.md).
