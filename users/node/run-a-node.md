# Run a Node

Running a Citrea node is permissonless - anyone can run a full node for development & security purposes. In this section, we'll go over necessary steps to run a Citrea node.

To sync with Citrea Testnet, you need to

- run a Bitcoin Testnet4 Node
    - [Method 1 (Docker)](./bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-docker.md)
    - [Method 2 (Source)](./bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-source.md)

- run a Citrea Testnet Full Node
    - [Method 1 (Binary)](./citrea-testnet/citrea-testnet-executable.md)
    - [Method 2 (Source)](./citrea-testnet/citrea-testnet-source.md)

since our full nodes are directly using Bitcoin as the DA layer.

Please note that there are no financial incentives to run a Citrea Testnet node.

### Hardware Requirements for running a node

A Linux/Mac/Windows system with a configuration of

- 8 GB Ram
- 256 GB SSD (NVMe recommended)
- 4 core CPU
- 25+ Mbps network connection

satisfies the minimum requirements to run a Citrea node.
