## Run a Node

Running a Citrea node is permissonless - anyone can run a full node for development & security purposes. In this section, we'll go over necessary steps to run a Citrea node.

To sync with Citrea Testnet, you need to:

1) [Run a Bitcoin Testnet4 Node](./bitcoin-testnet4/README.md)

2) [Run a Citrea Full Node](./citrea-testnet/README.md)

Please note that there are no financial incentives to run a Citrea full node.

#### Hardware Requirements for running a node

A Linux/Mac/Windows system with a configuration of

- 8 GB Ram
- 256 GB SSD (NVMe recommended)
- 4 core CPU
- 25+ Mbps network connection

satisfies the minimum requirements to run a Citrea node.

If you encounter any problems during the node running even though you have a system that fits the requirements, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/citrea) and let us now by opening a ticket.
