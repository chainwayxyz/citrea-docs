## Run a Citrea Testnet Full Node

In this section, we provide you two ways to run a Citrea Full Node. 
Please keep in mind that you should have a synced Testnet4 instance for the following methods. If you don't, please check [here](../bitcoin-testnet4/README.md).

- [Method 1 (Binary)](./citrea-testnet-executable.md)
    - Easier to setup using a binary executable built by us, less configurable, suitable for Linux / MacOS.

- [Method 2 (Source)](./citrea-testnet-source.md)
    - More general setup that allows developers to customize, also works for Windows.

If you encounter any problems during the node running even though you have a system that fits the requirements, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/citrea) and let us now by opening a ticket.
