# Bitcoin Testnet4

Citrea uses Bitcoin Testnet4 as a DA layer for its testnet. Thus, it is necessary to have a syncing Bitcoin Testnet4 node to run a Citrea Full Node.

In this section, we provide you two ways to run a Testnet4 node (Bitcoin v28.0rc1).

* [Method 1 (Docker)](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-docker)
  * Easier to setup but less configurable
* [Method 2 (Source)](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/bitcoin-testnet4/testnet4-source)
  * Harder to setup but more configurable

Once you're done syncing your Bitcoin node, you can proceed to run a Citrea Full Node [here](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/citrea-testnet).
