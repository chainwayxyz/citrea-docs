# Citrea Full Node

In this section, we provide you two ways to run a Citrea Full Node. Please keep in mind that you should have a synced Testnet4 instance for the following methods. If you don't, please check [here](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/bitcoin-testnet4).

* [Method 1 (Binary)](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/citrea-testnet/citrea-testnet-executable)
  * Easier to setup using a binary executable built by us, less configurable, suitable for Linux / MacOS.
* [Method 2 (Source)](https://docs.citrea.xyz/developer-documentation/run-a-node/citrea-testnet/citrea-testnet-source)
  * More general setup that allows developers to customize, also works for Windows.

If you encounter any problems during the node running even though you have a system that fits the requirements, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/citrea) and let us now by opening a ticket.
