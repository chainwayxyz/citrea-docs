## Interop / Bridges / Swaps

#### Hyperlane  

[Hyperlane](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/) is a permissionless interoperability framework that lets you pass arbitrary messages/tokens between Citrea and any other Hyperlane‑connected chain. Because deployments are contract‑level (no governance votes), you can spin up **Warp Routes** for your bApp in minutes and own the bridge logic end‑to‑end.

#### LayerZero  

[LayerZero](https://docs.layerzero.network/) provides ultra‑lightweight cross‑chain messaging secured by Decentralised Verifier Networks (DVNs). Citrea Testnet is fully integrated in LayerZero v2, so builders can call contracts, move tokens or tap existing LayerZero SDK helpers using the familiar endpoint config.

#### KRNL Labs kOS  

[KRNL Labs kOS](https://www.krnl.xyz/) acts as a “superconnector,” wiring Citrea smart contracts to external EVM chains, Web2 APIs and AI models. By plugging into kOS you can enrich transactions with off‑chain data **before** they hit Citrea’s zkEVM, or trigger cross‑chain side effects without writing bespoke bridge code.

You can checkout the KRNL documentation to kickstart your development: [https://www.krnl.xyz/docs](https://www.krnl.xyz/docs)

#### Garden Finance  

[Garden Finance](https://testnet.garden.finance/?input-chain=citrea_testnet&input-asset=cBTC) offers intents‑based BTC swaps that bridge native Bitcoin to cBTC on Citrea, using Hashed‑Timelock Contracts behind the scenes. 

Garden also offers an SDK for bApp developers. You can find the SDK documentation [here](https://docs.garden.finance/developers/sdk/overview).
