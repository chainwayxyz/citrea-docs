# Citrea RPC Docs

This folder contains JSON-RPC methods enabled on a Citrea node.

- [**`citrea-rpc-documentation.md`**](./citrea-rpc-documentation.md) has the Citrea-specific RPC methods (prefixed `citrea_`, `ledger_`, `debug_`, etc.) that extend beyond the standard Ethereum API. These endpoints are particularly useful in the rollup/Bitcoin settlement context, such as sequencer commitments, proofs, and more.
- [**`eth-rpc-endpoints.md`**](./eth-rpc-endpoints.md) has standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods that are **also** implemented by Citrea for wallet / tool compatibility.
