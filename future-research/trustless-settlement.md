# Trustless Settlement

In order to achive trustless settlement for Citrea, there need to be opcode change(s).

Mainly, an opcode that can verify ZK proofs and a covenant opcode would be required to implement completely trustless Bitcoin settlement. In the current architecture, BitVM provides trust-minimized settlement - which is a great improvement over the existing insecure implementations of sidechains.
