# Multi VM Approach

Citrea is designed to be compatible and interoperable with multiple virtual machines. It runs inside a generic STARK zkVM, meaning any virtual machine can be implemented and will produce execution proof.

Initially, Citrea implements the EVM VM, however implementing different VMs like WASM or SVM is possible thanks to its future-proof design.
