# Volition Model

Volition is a special type of data availability solution that combines off-chain and on-chain data. Very briefly, volitions allow users or apps to choose where to save their data for each transaction. The model allows applications with different data locations to be interoperable in a single blockchain. For example users may choose off-chain data availability for low fees with less security or they may choose Bitcoin data availability for regular fees with full security. No matter the data availability choice, every transaction continues to get proven with ZK proofs.

In short, the volition model provides Bitcoin equivalent validity, censorship resistance, and re-org resistance but leaves the data availability option to users or apps.
