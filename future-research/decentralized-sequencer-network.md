# Decentralized Sequencer Network

Citrea contributors are exploring solutions to support multiple sequencers in a consensus without affecting latency and finality. One possible approach to implement a PoS-like layer but for only sequencing blocks. The source of truth for users will always be zero-knowledge proofs in Bitcoin. Decentralized sequencing layer will reduce the short term trust to sequencer to protect the ordering, as the ordering will be finalized on the sequencing layer in a single slot.

There are several consensus mechanisms that are being experimented such as CometBFT, Hotstuff, and MonadBFT.
