# Decentralized Sequencer Network

A decentralized sequencer network is composed of multiple sequencers, each tasked with block production and transaction ordering according to the networkâ€™s algorithm. Citrea is a ZK Rollup that currently relies on a single sequencer, which provides strong security and non-custodial operation. However, it also introduces a single point of failure for liveness. Although censorship resistance can be achieved through force transactions, a decentralized sequencer network is ideal for addressing the liveness challenge by distributing responsibilities among multiple participants.

A few key challenges of decentralized sequencer networks are as follows:
- **Architecture**: Deciding the sequencer set (permissionless or not), modifying the architecture, determining the optimal consensus mechanism (e.g., CometBFT, Hotstuff, MonadBFT).
- **Latency**: Achieving consensus among multiple sequencers poses significant challenges due to the latency introduced by communication between sequencers. Ideally, a decentralized sequencer network should not introduce observable latency compared to the current implementation.
- **Economic Incentives**: The economic model should be designed to ensure that sequencers are rewarded for their work and penalized for misbehavior, for the network's security and liveness.

The concept is on the roadmap and active development & implementation will kick off after the mainnet launch.
