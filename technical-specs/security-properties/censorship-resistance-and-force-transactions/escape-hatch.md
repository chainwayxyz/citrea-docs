# Escape Hatch

Escape hatch is a specialized mechanism to ensure users can exit to L1 in case of chain halt.

Chain halts on Citrea are only possible if sequencer(s) or prover(s) halt to update the state, thus include the forced transactions fully. Details of the escape hatch is being researched at the moment.

Escape Hatch is still under research and won't be ready during the initial release.
