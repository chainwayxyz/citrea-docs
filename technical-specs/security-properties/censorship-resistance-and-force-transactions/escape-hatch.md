# Escape Hatch

The escape hatch is a specialized mechanism to ensure users can exit to L1 in case of a Citrea chain halt.

Chain halts on Citrea are only possible if sequencer(s) or prover(s) halt to update the state, and thus fail to fully include the forced transactions. Details of the escape hatch are still being researched at the moment. As such, the escape hatch will not be available at launch.
