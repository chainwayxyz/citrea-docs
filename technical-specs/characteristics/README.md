Characteristics of the Citrea blockchain.\
\
In short:

* Type 2 zkEVM
* Sequencer with a block producing privilege, inscribing state roots on Bitcoin to finalize ordering.
* Prover with a responsibility of producing batch proofs and light client proofs, both via scanning Bitcoin blockspace.
* Full and light nodes are able to easily and securely verify the blockchain.
* Bitcoin Settlement via BitVM. Citrea proofs are optimistically verified in Bitcoin, enabling the first universal trust-minimized bridge.
