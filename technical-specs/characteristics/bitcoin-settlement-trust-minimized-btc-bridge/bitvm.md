# BitVM

BitVM is a computing paradigm that enables turing complete smart contracts on Bitcoin. BitVM works thanks to taproot trees and fraud proofs.

Current BitVM implementation is work in progress independently by the BitVM team led by Robin Linus.  Citrea trust-minimized bridge program consists of an operator and verifier software and zk circuits of bridge. It is built on top of BitVM implementation by the BitVM team.

We acknowledge and thank for the efforts of the all BitVM contributors.
