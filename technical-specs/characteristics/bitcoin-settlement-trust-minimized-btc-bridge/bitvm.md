# BitVM

BitVM is a computing paradigm that enables turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin. BitVM works using Taproot trees and fraud proofs.

The current BitVM implementation is work in progress independently by the BitVM team led by Robin Linus. The Citrea trust-minimized bridge program consists of an operator and verifier software with zk circuits of the bridge. It is built on top of the BitVM implementation by the BitVM team.

We acknowledge and thank all BitVM contributors for the efforts.
