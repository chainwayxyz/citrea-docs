Citrea is the first rollup that enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin blockspace with zero knowledge technology. Citrea is the only scalability solution that uses Bitcoin both as a data availability and a settlement layer, via its BitVM-based trust-minimized two-way peg program - [Clementine](https://www.blog.citrea.xyz/unveiling-clementine/). Citrea is fully EVM compatible, enabling all the EVM developers to easily build on Bitcoin.
