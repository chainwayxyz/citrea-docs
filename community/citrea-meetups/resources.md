# Resources for Meetups

We deeply value the content quality & speaker knowledge for Citrea meetups. Therefore, here are some helpful links that you and the speaker can utilize for the meetups. 

These slides are prepared to give some ideas. While they're available to be used in the meetup, preparing an original talk is quite encouraged.

## Sample slides

- [An introduction to blockchains & Citrea](Sample Community Meetup Slides)

- [Targeted for developers who's been learning about the Web3 + EVM ecosystem](Sample Smart Contract Workshop)

- [Targeted for experienced audience](Advanced Community Meetup)
