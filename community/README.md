# Citrea Meetups & Ambassadors

Citrea is the first rollup that enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin blockspace with zero-knowledge technology. Through our journey of enabling Bitcoin to be the execution layer of world finance, we're lucky to have an amazing community that's been supporting us from day 1.

With the end of our successful public devnet & start of testnet, our team continues to ship in a more faster, more careful, and more secure way. With that, it's also time to reflect what Citrea offers to the world even more focused. 

We're introducing **Citrea Ambrassadors & Meetups** for this mission - a series of events that will enable our community members to propose and launch initiatives.
